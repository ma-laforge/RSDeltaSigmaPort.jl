# RSDeltaSigmaPort: Sample notebooks

## :warning: Environment stack
Jupyter notebooks seems to have a built-in mechanism that recursively adds
***all*** `Project.toml` files appearing in the active `.ipynb` notebook's
("real path") parent directories to the environment stack.

## Blank notebooks
The notebooks in this folder should all be clear of data to avoid repository bloat.

## Notebooks that include outputs
Notebooks that include outputs can be found [here]().
